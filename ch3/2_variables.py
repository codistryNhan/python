#Lesson 2 variables
#NOTE: Python does not use semicolons or brackets.

#Variable names like in other languages can only contain
#letters, numbers and underscores

#Variable names cannot start with numbers
#stick with lowercase names since Upperclass are usually for Classnames
#user camelCase

message = "Hello World"

print(message)
